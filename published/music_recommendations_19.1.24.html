<h1>Music Recommendations</h1>

<h2>blablabla</h2>

<p> I spend most of my time listening to music, I tend to have a couple of songs that I listen all the time and some that I forget about and then find again after some time. Ill just post what im listening atm so I can get back to this songs. </p>

<h2>And So I Watch You From Afar</h2>

<p> I have been listening to them for a couple months and are one of my favorite bands at the moment. The way most songs are almost a story told with guitars its pretty damn impressive, if you dont get what Im saying just listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xv34EGMJd6g"><span id="code">I'll Share A Life</span></a>. I fucking love when guitars sing </p>

<p> My favorite album has been The Endless Shimmering, My recommended songs are The Endless Shimmering (the song), Mullaly, Ill Share a Life, Big Thinks Do Remarkable and A Little bit of Solidarity goes a Long Way. </p>

<a href="https://asiwyfa.bandcamp.com/album/the-endless-shimmering"><span id="code">Check Them Out</span></a>.

<h2>Manfred Minnich</h2>

<p> Youtube algorithm has brought me this gem of album called Retro Things With Strings lovely songs that remind me a lot to stuff I would listen on old cartoons. I have this on the background all the time. My favorite track by far is <a href="https://youtu.be/UwcMpDidEhI?feature=shared&t=3220"><span id="code">No More</span></a>. </p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwcMpDidEhI"><span id="code">Retro Things With Strings</span></a>.

<h2>Shady Cicada</h2>

<p> This artist would not stop appearing in my spotify Discover Weekly and with good reason he makes some good ass instrumental rock. I dont think he has realised this songs on a proper album yet but this are my top picks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfCtUj94fXA"><span id="code">Stardust</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVmBnge6PK4">System Failure</span></a> . </p>

<p> Searching for links to his songs I found out he also makes videos and streams himself making most of his songs what a lad, here is his channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-90KuSWRVLImW4xHWFYMnQ"><span id="code">Shady Cicada</span></a>. </p>

<h2>Aiobahn</h2>

<p> Future Bass like beats, some are really <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z8y7enYB30">relaxing</a>, some are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptKDIAXYoE8">crazy</a>, some have really <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfrBPWDTCpE">cool beats</a>. One of the best artists ive discovered recently, songs are all really catchy and I patiently wait for more releases, as of writing this he uploaded this song and its so damn good. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olWq4GUMYaw"><span id="code">non-reflection</span></a>. </p>

<p> All linked songs are my favorites. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3XZCxTQ55JkT35W27Jtbyg">Aiobahn</a> </p>

# Music Recommendations

## blablabla

I spend most of my time listening to music, I tend to have a couple of songs that I listen to that I then forget about that I then try to find again after some time. So I'll just post what im listening atm so I can get back to this songs in the future. 

## And So I Watch You From Afar

I have been listening to them for a couple months and they are one of my favorite bands at the moment. The way most songs get a story told with guitars its pretty damn impressive, if you dont get what Im saying just listen to [`I'll Share A Life`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xv34EGMJd6g). I fucking love when guitars feel like they are singing to each other.

My favorite album has been The Endless Shimmering, I recommend The Endless Shimmering (the song), Mullaly, Ill Share a Life, Big Thinks Do Remarkable and A Little bit of Solidarity goes a Long Way.

[`Check Them Out`](https://asiwyfa.bandcamp.com/album/the-endless-shimmering).

## Manfred Minnich

Youtube algorithm has brought to me this gem of album called Retro Things With Strings lovely songs that remind me a lot to stuff I would listen on old cartoons. I have this on the background all the time. My favorite track by far is [`No More`](https://youtu.be/UwcMpDidEhI?feature=shared&t=3220).

## Shady Cicada

This artist would not stop appearing in my spotify Discover Weekly and with good reason he makes some good ass instrumental rock. I dont think he has released this songs on a proper album yet but this are my top picks [`Stardust`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfCtUj94fXA) and [`System Failure`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVmBnge6PK4) .

Searching for links to his songs I found out he also makes videos and streams himself making most of his songs what a lad, here is his channel [`Shady Cicada`](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-90KuSWRVLImW4xHWFYMnQ).

## Aiobahn

Future Bass like beats, some are [relaxing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z8y7enYB30), some are [all over the place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptKDIAXYoE8), some have [cool beats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfrBPWDTCpE). Honestly one of the best artists ive discovered recently, songs are all really catchy and I patiently wait for more releases, as of writing this he uploaded this new song, also pretty damn good: [`non-reflection`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olWq4GUMYaw).

All linked songs are my favorites. [Aiobahn](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3XZCxTQ55JkT35W27Jtbyg)

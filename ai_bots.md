# Bot players in videogames

Have you ever entered multiplayer of a videogame, you feel like youre doing good.. too good? Did I get thrown in a low level player game? Some matchmaking magic?
Nop. What you are looking at its AI bots made to look like real players, designed to have a name that, on a glance, look like a player. 
They are put in game to make you feel better at this games, to fill empty lobbies and sometimes to make you learn the game and join the seasoned players. This is so common that its not hard to find game tutorials that make you play an AI filled match before throwing you into the actual multiplayer.

In my early days of gaming my only way to play most multiplayers game was either go to a cyber(a internet cafe without the coffee) or to play the vsIA gamemode with bots. 
Hence I got a lot of good experiencies playing Star Wars Battlefront, Medal of honor, Killzone but I also got some bad experiences while playing CS Source
I used to get mad when the moderator of a server would try to lie telling me this are real players when I can clearly tell that thats a bot in expert with a modified username, in retrospect I realized that whenever a couple of slots were empty the server had an addon that would fill the game with bots in expert that would use the usernames of people that had recently top fragged and were offline, it was kinda neat, almost a sign of respect for players that were a regular on the server.
Some games knew that internet was not a given and they got made with the content available even in those cases which I will be forever grateful with the devs of that time

Nowadays my experiences with bots are not so good anymore, my latest instance of something to do with bots and the thing that made me write these up was Arena Breakout Infinite, a tarkov-like looter shooter. In the search of something similar to Escape From Tarkov but actually optimized and with good patching I found this game and I cannot lie I was excited, it does the job in almost every aspect while keeping it original and with a lot of better implementations, but in the 20~ games I've played both solo and with friends I have killed way too many PMCs (real players), this type of game is supposed to be hard really, so I was really curious as of why the players in this game seem so new at it.
So I just started trying to add everyone I get in a game, and out of the 30ish players I found in game, the system only found 2 existing players. 2 out of 30.


Is it just nostalgia or is the way they are using it now bad? 
A lot of times honestly its the latter.

Good depending in the type of game? 
I think that if you have a bot implemented in game you should allow an offline mode with a lobby full of them, this allows the game to be played without the help of the publisher.

Im sure a good implementation of bots can help a game out there with helping beginners and making matchmaking not take too long (this would would really help regions with lower playerbases). But in this theorical good implementation the game should inform the player that this is the case, this type of game need a exclamation mark informing me that there is not that many players at the moment so there is a chance that I can get queued up with bots.
There is no greater dissapointment that entering a game, kill a player with a shady username and instantly understand that you are just playing against a bunch of coded behavior of what a player is supposed to look like.

Entering a multiplayer match should match you with players (wow), real players. Winning should feel like you tried and bested someone.

But then I started thinking why would they not just tell you that there might be bots inside the match beforehand ? 
Are this games are trying not to be seen like they have lower playerbases or they just want players to feel good just killing bots.. but at the same time this same player would probably love the 'vs Ia' mode way more. 

Basically: `Please make multiplayer games available offline and if you are gonna introduce bots for whatever reason into your game inform the players about it.`


This blog came to me after uninstalling Arena Breakout out of boredom and hearing [the last minute of this video](https://youtu.be/tiEtm02Jc3M?feature=shared&t=394)
